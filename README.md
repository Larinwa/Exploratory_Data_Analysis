# Analyzing the Impact of Socio-Economic and Health Indicators on Life Expectancy

## Overview
This project explores how socio-economic and health indicators influence life expectancy across developed and developing countries. 
Using statistical and visual analysis, the study identifies key variables—such as GDP per capita, schooling, and infant mortality—that significantly affect life expectancy outcomes.

## Objectives
- Examine the relationship between economic indicators and health outcomes.
- Identify significant predictors of life expectancy using statistical tests.
- Compare life expectancy patterns between developed and developing countries.

## Methodology
- Data Source: Life Expectancy dataset containing global socio-economic and health metrics.
- Techniques Used:  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib)  
  - Correlation and hypothesis testing (t-test, Pearson correlation, Chi-square)  
  - Comparative analysis across regions and economic groups  

## Key Insights
- Life expectancy is positively correlated with schooling and GDP per capita.
- Infant mortality shows a strong negative relationship with life expectancy.
- Statistically significant differences exist between developed and developing nations.
- Economic growth alone has diminishing returns on life expectancy at higher income levels.

## Tools and Libraries
`Python`, `Pandas`, `Seaborn`, `Matplotlib`, `Plotly`, `Scipy`, `Statsmodels`, `Sklearn`

## Result Summary
The analysis highlights that education and healthcare access play stronger roles in determining life expectancy than income alone. Targeted investments in these areas could substantially improve global health outcomes.
